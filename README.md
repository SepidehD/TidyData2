## Submission

* Collect *any* space-time dataset
  * You can do this in groups
* Read in data, and

  * You can also try to implement your own if you want
* Present your workflow as an annotated Notebook
  * Notebook should desribe your data, your exploratory steps, and your results

This is a very open ended lab. I want you to use as many external resources as needed to get this done. At a minimum, you should have a dataset that contains location and time information. If required, you should 'tidy' this data (particularly for plotting). You should visualize this data, and you should explore this data prior to choosing an analysis technique. You have a limited set of tools to choose from, so choose the one that is *most* appropriate (it might **not** ultimately be the best method). Work in groups if you want, but submit your *own* Notebook please.
